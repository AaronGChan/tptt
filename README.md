# Recurrent Neural Networks with Target Propagation
Numpy with manual gradient calculations for TPTT with RNNs for a class project. </br>
If you want the PyTorch version, view the old/tptt_mnist.py file. </br>
Much of the code was taken from https://github.com/nmanchev/MM-TPTT-RNN/blob/main/task_a/rnn_stptt.py, but we removed the stochastic nature of that code as well and modified it to address our project's requirement of no machine learning frameworks and manual graident calculations. </br>
